* Ruby version - 2.2.0

* System dependencies - rails, mysql

* Configuration - huh?

* Database creation - treasures (db name)

* Database initialization - prizes (created and migrated)

run rails server for directory in console, view through browser. Then, there is CRUD. Barely, but it's there.

Peace (drops mic)
