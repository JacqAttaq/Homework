# player cards [2,2,2,2,3]
#get twwo random cards and give to player
#show the cards
#hit or stay
# hit - get another card from deck
# stay  - no more cards
# game over - cards <=21 you win
					#>21 you lose

# deal two cards - figure out how to pick two out of array

# array methods shuffle, select, take, sample

# empty array for user cards - suffle, push from deck, pop to user
#find out inject. can use break to break out of loop and continue on code
# inject takes every element in array and sums it up
# flatten array? if you pop or sample more than one option at once it will return a two dimensional array
# dont need card type, just number array
# irb - interactive ruby - test code, see what things do |variable|
